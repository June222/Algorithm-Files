### No.1629 - Multiplication

# Algorithm Used :
	1. Modular arithmetic
	2. Multiplication by using Divide-and-Conquer

# Goal :
	1. Multiply A by B times and Find remainder dividing by C.

# Problem needed to be Adressed :
	1. Modular arithmetic && Overflow
	-> 1) The square of int data type that requires 4 bytes is can expressed as a long long data type.
	-> 2) But, if it is more than cube, Overflow occurs. In this case, what is needed is Modular arithmetic.

	-> 3) (B * C) mod D = B mod D * C mod D.  
	-> 4) so, if A = B * C then, A mod D = (B * C) mod D holds, 
	-> 5) A mod D = B mod D * C mod D.

	-> 6) This allows int * int to get remainder without Overflow.


	2. Time Complexity
	-> 1) The number of 2.1 billion is too large, so we must reduced Time Complexity to O(log N).
	-> 2) I knew that Time Complexity had to be reduced to O(log N) and it was Problem to be solved using Modular arithmetic, But I didn't know how to implement.
	

	3. Idea for Implementation
	-> The simplest way to O(log N) is to keep dividing by 2.(like Binary Search)

	-> 1-1) A^B 
			= A ^ (B/2) ^ 2 (when B % 2 == 0)

	-> 1-2) A^B mod C
			= {A ^ (B/2) ^ 2} mod C

	-> 2-1) A^B 
			= {A ^ (B/2) ^ 2} * A (when B % 2 != 0)

	-> 2-2) A^B mod C
			= [{A ^ (B/2) ^ 2} mod C * A] mod C
